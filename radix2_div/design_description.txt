Implement a simplified radix-2 divider module and the inputs are two 8-bit operands. The module uses a simple 4-state finite state machine (FSM) to control the division process.
It has a parameter DATAWIDTH, which is set to 8 by default but can be changed when instantiating the module.

Module name:  
    radix2_div 

Parameter：
DATAWIDTH = 8  
Input ports：
    input 		[DATAWIDTH-1:0]	dividend 	,  		
    input 		[DATAWIDTH-1:0]	divisor 	,   	
    input						clk 	 	,	 	
    input                       rst_n	    ,
    input                       en
Output ports：
    output 		[DATAWIDTH-1:0] quotient 	,  		
    output 		[DATAWIDTH-1:0] remainder   ,
    output wire         ready       ,
    output wire         vld_out

State Machine:
IDLE: Initial state, waiting for the enable signal (en) to become active.
SUB: Subtract state, where the actual subtraction of divisor from dividend takes place.
SHIFT: Shift state, shifting the dividend left (effectively multiplying by 2) until a certain condition is met.
DONE: Done state, indicating the completion of the division.

State Transition Logic:
The next_state logic determines the next state based on the current state and the enable signal.
State Register:
current_state: Represents the current state of the FSM.
next_state: Represents the next state to transition to.

Data Registers:
dividend_e: Extended version of the dividend to facilitate arithmetic operations.
divisor_e: Extended version of the divisor.
quotient_e: Register to store the calculated quotient.
remainder_e: Register to store the calculated remainder.
count: Counter for tracking the number of shifts performed.

State Transition and Data Computation:
State transition and data computation are performed in the combinational blocks using always @(*) and case statements.

Output Assignments:
quotient and remainder are assigned values from their respective registers.
ready is asserted when the current state is IDLE.
vld_out is asserted when the current state is DONE.

Reset Logic:
Resets all data registers and counters to zero on a negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal.
